Several SNPs have more than one rsid probing the same position on the same chromosome. Concordance of the results from these probes permit an estimate of error rates.

For my own data at these sites, only about half report nucleotide composition. For all but four of these, all probes give the same answer.

Of these discordant four, listed below, two appear to probe opposite strands, one probe reporting CC, the other, GG. The other two sites give incompatible results.

From this, I estimate that 1-3% of the reported SNP results are incorrect.

Is this consistent with other data?
